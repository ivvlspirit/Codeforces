# Codeforces

In this repository I will publish some of the tools I use for competitive programming on Codeforces, as well as some of my most succesful contests.

## Current status

I currently hold the title Expert. My max. rating is 1689, and I regularly compete in Div. 2 competitions

## Contests

Here are the contests you can find in this repository:
- Round #690 (Div. 3) - 69th place, solved all the tasks
- Round #699 (Div. 2) - 471st place, solved tasks A-D

## Setup

In Setup folder you can find my setup for competitive programming contests on Codeforces.

#### template.cpp

This is the template with which I begin all of my tasks, it helps me reduce the time spent on programming so I can focus more on coming up with the solution.

#### new-round.cpp

This is the code used for creating all of the files needed to solve the contest. The program asks for the round number (e.g. 1462 for the Codeforces round #690 Div. 3) and the number of tasks, and then creates a folder (e.g. /1462) and copies template.cpp to all the necessary .cpp files (e.g. 1462A.cpp, 1462B.cpp, etc.).
